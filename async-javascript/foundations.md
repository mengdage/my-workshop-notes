# Foundation of JavaScript

As soon as we start running code, we create a **global execution context**

- Thread of execution (parsing and executing the code line after line)

- Live memory of variables with data (known as a Global Variable Environment)

When you execute a function, you create a new **execution context**:

- The thread of execution (go through the code in the function line by line)

- A local memory ('Variable environment') where anything defined in the function is stored
