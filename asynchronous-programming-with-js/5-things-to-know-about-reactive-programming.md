# Reactive Programmings

## Reactive Programming is Programming with Asynchronous Data Streams

With reactive programming, you observe data streams and react when a value is emitted.

Data stream can be anything: click events, HTTP requests, ingested messages, availability notifications, changes on a variable, cache events, measures from a sensor, literally anything that may change or happen.
