# CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimentional system, and can handle both columns and row.

- Unlike flexbox which is a 1-dimentional system.
- Apply CSS rules both to parent element (Grid Container) and to that element's children (Grid Items).
