# The technology of blockchain

Autonomous internet digital based system for interaction vs. tranditional physical interaction


Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency run on a blockchain. It solved the **double spend problem**.

Bitcoin focuses more on financial transactions.
Ethereum focues more on decentralized application development.

Users need Ether to use the application on the Ethereum network. Apps need to spend Ether in order to run actions. Every single smart contract has to spend Ether to verify and execute the contract on the network. This provides fundamental layer that would allow the Uber example to exist. 

Without Ether, a certain decentralized application might use too much computing power, and not leave enough capabilities for other decentralized application to use. Ether is a way to manage the computing power based on minors (computers) on the network.

## Ethereum network

The primary purpose of Ethereum is to be a global virtual machine.

Most of the value come from the decentralized app layer and building blocks for the decentralized economy.

### Proof of work vs. proof of stake
