## What is Gatsby

- Gatsby is a *shortcut* to allow developers to quickly build excellent apps and sites.

Most workflows involves a lot of boilerplate to get started.

```
Terminal --[ webpack, babel, nodeJS, docker, nginx, etc. ]--> web app
```

Gatsby removes the boilerplate for getting started & deploying apps to production.

```
Terminal --[ Gatsby, netlify ]--> web app
```

- Gatsby is an *orchestration layer* for taming the Content Mesh and its many sources of data.

- Gatsby is a *Progressive Web App* generator designed to make the right thing the easy thing.
